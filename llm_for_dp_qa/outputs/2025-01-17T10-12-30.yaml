- question: In a few words, what is differential privacy?
  human:
    ? 'Differential privacy is a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy. Consider
      an algorithm that analyzes a dataset and releases statistics: The algorithm
      is differentially private if by looking at the output, you cannot tell whether
      any individual''s data was included in the original dataset or not. Differential
      privacy achieves this by carefully injecting random noise into the released
      statistics to hide the effects of each individual.

          differential privacy?
        expected: true
        actual:
        - Yes.
      - evalution: Does the answer describe adding calibrated noise to statistics?
        expected: true
        actual:
        - Yes.
      - evalution: Does the answer describe anonymizing data by stripping identifiers?
        expected: false
        actual:
        - 'No'
  llm:
    ? Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that ensures the privacy of
      individuals in a dataset by adding noise to the data or the results of queries,
      making it difficult to identify any individual's information while still allowing
      for useful aggregate insights.
