q_and_a:
- question: In a few words, what is differential privacy?
  human_answer: 'Differential privacy is a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy.
    Consider an algorithm that analyzes a dataset and releases statistics: The algorithm
    is differentially private if by looking at the output, you cannot tell whether
    any individual''s data was included in the original dataset or not. Differential
    privacy achieves this by carefully injecting random noise into the released statistics
    to hide the effects of each individual.

    '
  llm_answers:
  - Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that ensures the privacy of individuals
    in a dataset by adding noise to the data or the results of queries, making it
    difficult to identify any individual's information while still allowing for useful
    aggregate insights.
