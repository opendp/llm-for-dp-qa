- question: In a few words, what is differential privacy?
  human:
    ? 'Differential privacy is a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy. Consider
      an algorithm that analyzes a dataset and releases statistics: The algorithm
      is differentially private if by looking at the output, you cannot tell whether
      any individual''s data was included in the original dataset or not. Differential
      privacy achieves this by carefully injecting random noise into the released
      statistics to hide the effects of each individual.

    : - evalution: Does the answer mention the rigorous mathematical definition of
          differential privacy?
        expected: true
        actual:
        - 'Yes'
      - evalution: Does the answer describe adding calibrated noise to statistics?
        expected: true
        actual:
        - Yes.
      - evalution: Does the answer describe anonymizing data by stripping identifiers?
        expected: false
        actual:
        - 'No'

    ? Differential privacy is like a magic cloak that helps keep your secrets safe
      when sharing information. It makes sure that even if someone looks at the data,
      they can't tell anything special about you!
