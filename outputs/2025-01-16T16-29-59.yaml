q_and_a:
- question: In a few words, what is differential privacy?
  human_answer: 'Differential privacy is a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy.
    Consider an algorithm that analyzes a dataset and releases statistics: The algorithm
    is differentially private if by looking at the output, you cannot tell whether
    any individual''s data was included in the original dataset or not. Differential
    privacy achieves this by carefully injecting random noise into the released statistics
    to hide the effects of each individual.

    '
  llm_answers:
  - Differential privacy is a framework designed to provide strong privacy guarantees
    when analyzing and sharing statistical data. It ensures that the inclusion or
    exclusion of an individual's data does not significantly affect the output of
    a function, thereby protecting individual privacy while still allowing for useful
    insights from aggregated data.
